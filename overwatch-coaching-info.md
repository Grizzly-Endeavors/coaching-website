# Overwatch Coaching - Comprehensive Information Document

## Origin Story & Background

**How I Got Into Overwatch:**
My dad bought us both Overwatch when it first launched. Before then, I hadn't played any shooters - hero or otherwise. But Overwatch was different. I was immediately drawn to the characters and the strategy within the game.

**Transition to Coaching:**
I've always had a knack for breaking things down and explaining them. As I started connecting with others and making friends in the days after launch, I found myself naturally helping others understand matchups, how team comps work together, and how to get value with their hero's abilities. I've been coaching in parallel with playing organized Overwatch almost the whole time, and I'm only just now stepping away from the player side.

## Experience & Credentials

**Competitive Achievements:**
- Highest team play: 4.4k (High Grandmaster) on DPS
- Ranked peak: GM1 across all roles

**What Shaped My Coaching:**
Getting to GM on every role shaped my coaching the most. It taught me the steps for identifying issues and addressing them in a sustainable way. Playing at that high level is so fast that it forces you to really focus on what matters - and that clarity translates directly into my coaching approach.

## Coaching Philosophy

### What "Sustainable Improvement" Means

**Not Losing Sight of Fun:**
At the end of the day, I'm not going pro. Most people aren't, and there's nothing wrong with that. Even when you're trying to push yourself as hard as you can, it's not worth suffering for. It's still a game.

**Making the Most of Your Time:**
Sustainable improvement means not spending endless hours aimlessly grinding, hoping your brain figures it out. Consistent short bursts of focused practice are consistently more effective for improving gameplay.

**The Physical Element:**
If you aren't sleeping well, staying hydrated, or eating consistently, all those things can deeply affect your gameplay. There's just so much more that goes into improvement than most people understand.

### The Holistic Approach (When Appropriate)

I know a lot of people play games like these as an escape, so I don't typically dig into lifestyle factors unless I have a really good reason to, or the client says something that makes it seem like that conversation would be valuable for them.

Most people aren't going pro, and the stuff outside of the game isn't a major factor until high Masters. But I will bring it up for players who:
- Have issues with their aim being unsteady or shaky
- Directly or indirectly seem to struggle with tilt

### Core Principles

1. **Mindset matters the most**
2. **Quality practice is way more important than quantity of play**
3. **There are no quick fixes** - you have to commit to showing up and doing the work day after day

## Coaching Methodology

### Pattern Recognition

I always look for repeated patterns. I typically review the replays clients send me before we sit down for an actual review session, so I have a chance to filter out all the one-off mistakes that everybody makes from time to time from the ongoing patterns that are really holding them back.

**Why This Matters:**
This is one of the major things that differentiates external coaching from self-review. Self-review can be really powerful and you can get really far with it, but it's easy to miss the things you do over and over again that are just how you play.

**Actionable Focus:**
Looking at patterns makes it very clear what specific things a player can do to improve.

**Example:** One of the most common things I see across all ranks is autopiloting down the same path over and over again. For these players, I almost always recommend spending time consciously choosing to go anywhere besides their default path. This simultaneously breaks the bad habit and allows them to build a new one that leverages map geometry to their advantage.

### Teaching How to Think, Not What to Do

Overwatch is an insanely complicated game, so the odds of the same situation coming up multiple times is almost zero. Trying to tell somebody exactly what to do is almost always a waste of time. They'll be better off having the tools to figure out what to do on the fly.

## Coaching Formats

### 1. Asynchronous VOD Review (Most Accessible)
A player sends me their replay code(s). I look it over when I have the chance and send them structured notes with one or two focused things they can work on.

### 2. Live VOD Review Sessions (Primary Offering)
- I review the code beforehand and pick one, maybe two key lessons to focus on
- We go through the session together
- I pause at certain points and ask questions about what they were thinking and what they would do differently if they could go back
- I guide their thought process toward the answers that will help them

**Why This Works:**
There are studied reasons for this approach, but for me it really comes down to wanting to teach players how to think, not just what to do.

### 3. Live Coaching (For Specific Situations)
I usually only recommend this for players who know what they need to do but have a really stubborn habit they can't break.

**Why It's Effective:**
Especially at high levels, the game moves faster than you can think, which can make it really hard to disrupt bad habits as they're happening. By sitting over their shoulder, I can do the legwork of catching those things before they happen and directing them to do something different. This helps break patterns enough that they can continue the process on their own.

## Coaching Style

My personal style is playful roasting. I apply my philosophy and guide players through the things they're struggling with, but there will likely be some:
- "So... what did you think was gonna happen?"
- "Hey man, that's like all 5 of them, I don't think you ever win that."

It's just more fun for me (and usually for players as well). It makes sessions feel less like being lectured and more like improving with a friend who keeps it real with you.

## Ideal Client

**Anyone who wants to be the best they can be while still having fun.**

I work best with players who want to work with me. If you're engaged and willing to put in the work, I will go above and beyond to help you get where you're trying to go.

Beyond that, anyone seeking coaching likely already has the mindset needed to make the improvements they're looking to make. At that point it just becomes how much effort they're willing to put in.

## Success Story

### The Overthinking Hitscan

My favorite success story is about a hitscan player I've been working with for a long time. Really smart player - we did a ton of VODs together, but eventually he hit a plateau. It started to feel like we were just plugging holes in the dam.

Admittedly it took me some time to figure out, but I realized that him being smart was getting in the way. The problem wasn't that he didn't know what to do - it was that he knew too much and it was slowing him down. He was paralyzed trying to figure out what the right thing to do was.

We ended up doing a few live sessions to get him out of his own head and into the game. When it clicked, it was night and day difference. He went from struggling to keep up at low Masters straight to going toe-to-toe with grandmasters.

## What Sets Me Apart

My personal style of playful roasting combined with a teaching methodology that focuses on how to think rather than what to do. I apply my philosophy of sustainable improvement and guide players through their struggles in a way that's actually enjoyable.

## Common Misconceptions

**The biggest misconception I wish more people understood:**
VODs and getting coaching aren't as boring as they're made out to be, and it's absolutely worth investing in - even if it's for a video game. I feel like a lot of people are turned away before they even try.

## Lasting Impact

When someone finishes working with me - whether after a few sessions or a longer coaching relationship - I want them to be proud of themselves, the work they put in, and what they managed to achieve. Whether that's more or less than what they'd been aiming for.
