  # Biography paragraphs
  bio:
    paragraph_1: "My dad bought us both Overwatch when it first launched. Before then, I hadn't played any shooters - hero or otherwise. But Overwatch was different. I was immediately drawn to the characters and the strategy within the game."
    paragraph_2: "I've always had a knack for breaking things down and explaining them. As I started connecting with others and making friends in the days after launch, I found myself naturally helping others understand matchups, how team comps work together, and how to get value with their hero's abilities."
    paragraph_3: "I've been coaching in parallel with playing organized Overwatch almost the whole time, and I'm only just now stepping away from the player side. Getting to GM on every role shaped my coaching the most - it taught me the steps for identifying issues and addressing them in a sustainable way."

  points:
    - title: "Playful Roasting Style"
      description: "Sessions feel less like being lectured and more like improving with a friend who keeps it real. Expect some \"So... what did you think was gonna happen?\" moments. It's just more fun this way."

    - title: "Pattern Recognition Focus"
      description: "I review replays beforehand to filter out one-off mistakes from the ongoing patterns that are really holding you back. This is what separates external coaching from self-review."

    - title: "All Roles at GM Level"
      description: "Reaching GM1 on Tank, DPS, and Support means I understand what actually matters at every level. That high-level play is so fast it forces you to focus on what's important."

    - title: "Still Fun While Pushing Hard"
      description: "At the end of the day, it's still a game. Even when you're trying to push yourself as hard as you can, it's not worth suffering for. Sustainable improvement means keeping the fun in it."
