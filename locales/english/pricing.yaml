faq:
  section_title: "Frequently Asked Questions"

  questions:
    - question: "What rank do I need to be?"
      answer: "Anyone who wants to be the best they can be while still having fun. I work best with players who want to work with me - if you're engaged and willing to put in the effort, I'll go above and beyond to help you get where you're trying to go."

    - question: "Is coaching really worth it for a video game?"
      answer: "VODs and coaching aren't as boring as they're made out to be. It's absolutely worth investing in - even for a video game. A lot of people are turned away before they even try, but most find it way more valuable and enjoyable than they expected."

    - question: "What's your coaching style like?"
      answer: "Playful roasting. There will likely be some \"So... what did you think was gonna happen?\" moments. It makes sessions feel less like being lectured and more like improving with a friend who keeps it real. It's just more fun this way (for both of us)."

    - question: "How long does it take to see improvement?"
      answer: "There are no quick fixes - you have to commit to showing up and doing the work day after day. But with quality practice focused on what actually matters, you'll see progress faster than grinding aimlessly for hours."

    - question: "What payment methods do you accept?"
      answer: "All major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) through our secure Stripe payment processor."
